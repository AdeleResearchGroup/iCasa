/**
 * This class provides the basic implementation of a creator factory object for iPOJO instances.
 * 
 * The creator is in charge of keeping a list of created instances, and dynamically handle availability
 * of the corresponding iPOJO factory.
 * 
 * If a factory is no longer available, all instances are automatically disposed, but the creator keeps
 * enough information to try to recreate them when the factory will be available again.
 * 
 * All requests for creation of components that are received while the factory is unavailable will be 
 * remembered, and be automatically processed when the factory will be available again.
 * 
 * It is also possible to programmatically enable/disable the creator. This has the same effect as changing
 * the availability of the factory.
